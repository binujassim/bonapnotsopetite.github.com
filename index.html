<h2>Deacon's Corner</h2>

<p>So I found myself at Deacon’s Corner the other day and boy, was it a journey. Deacon's corner specializes in Southern style comfort cuisine and has been serving up some hearty meals since 2009. We visited the location on Main St (it's very close to Gastown) but there is another location in Kitsilano. Deacon’s Corner is exactly what would pop into my head if I had to imagine a suburban diner (except that it’s technically in Gastown).  Although it was fairly crowded we were seated promptly and things were looking fantastic.</p>

<p>Skip ahead about 10 minutes, we ordered two of my favourite things in the world… Chicken and Waffles (it came with two eggs on the side done however you’d like) and a side of hash. Soon after, the food arrived and it looked amazing. A thick waffle with powdered sugar dusted over it and a golden piece of fried chicken lying on top just waiting to be devoured.  Despite wanting to shove my face in all that glory I had enough self-control to snap a few pictures before I dove headfirst. </p>

<p>The first bite was great. Maybe it was all that anticipation, but the combination of the sweet waffle and the crispy mildly herby chicken was a wonderful pair. The second bite: equally good. But then around the third bite, it started to taste a little funky, to say the least.  Somehow the chicken tasted like cleaning products. Now I'm not one to continue eating food that tastes like Clorox, so I smelt it and I kid you not, it smelled like bleach! After talking to the waitress she took it back to the kitchen and shortly came back with my plate, minus the chicken. I was told that they’d give me a different piece but that it was all the same chicken. </p>

<p>While I waited I ate my waffle and hash because a. I was starving and b. some questionable chicken wasn’t going to stop me from enjoying a perfectly good waffle. It was slightly denser than a regular waffle giving it almost a cake-like feel and the sweetness from the powdered sugar combined with the sugar in the batter itself made syrup almost unnecessary. The hash was the perfect balance of soft and crunchy and tasted great with the help of a little salt and pep. </p>

<p>A while later, a piping hot piece of chicken arrived. It was quite delicious. It definitely didn’t taste like Clorox but it felt a little overpowered by the dill in their seasoning. Besides that, it was a decent piece of chicken.</p>

<p>Now, to put it in perspective, I felt that the “Clorox Chicken” incident definitely put a damper on the whole experience; however, that (I sincerely hope) does not happen often. It is worth mentioning that they had great service and large portion sizes which left you feeling swaddled in the comfort that southern food is known for. Overall, I would give Deacon’s Corner a solid 3.5/5.</p>
