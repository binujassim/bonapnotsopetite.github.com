<p>So I found myself at Deacon’s Corner the other day and boy, was it a journey. Deacon's corner specializes in Southern style comfort cuisine and has been serving up some hearty meals since 2009. We visited the location on Main St (it's very close to Gastown) but there is another location in Kitsilano. Deacon’s Corner is exactly what would pop into my head if I had to imagine a suburban diner (except that it’s technically in Gastown).  Although it was fairly crowded we were seated promptly and things were looking fantastic.</p>

<p>Skip ahead about 10 minutes, we ordered two of my favourite things in the world… Chicken and Waffles (it came with two eggs on the side done however you’d like) and a side of hash. Soon after, the food arrived and it looked amazing. A thick waffle with powdered sugar dusted over it and a golden piece of fried chicken lying on top just waiting to be devoured.  Despite wanting to shove my face in all that glory I had enough self-control to snap a few pictures before I dove headfirst. </p>

<p>The first bite was great. Maybe it was all that anticipation, but the combination of the sweet waffle and the crispy mildly herby chicken was a wonderful pair. The second bite: equally good. But then around the third bite, it started to taste a little funky, to say the least.  Somehow the chicken tasted like cleaning products. Now I'm not one to continue eating food that tastes like Clorox, so I smelt it and I kid you not, it smelled like bleach! After talking to the waitress she took it back to the kitchen and shortly came back with my plate, minus the chicken. I was told that they’d give me a different piece but that it was all the same chicken. </p>

<p>While I waited I ate my waffle and hash because a. I was starving and b. some questionable chicken wasn’t going to stop me from enjoying a perfectly good waffle. It was slightly denser than a regular waffle giving it almost a cake-like feel and the sweetness from the powdered sugar combined with the sugar in the batter itself made syrup almost unnecessary. The hash was the perfect balance of soft and crunchy and tasted great with the help of a little salt and pep. </p>

<p>A while later, a piping hot piece of chicken arrived. It was quite delicious. It definitely didn’t taste like Clorox but it felt a little overpowered by the dill in their seasoning. Besides that, it was a decent piece of chicken.</p>

<p>Now, to put it in perspective, I felt that the “Clorox Chicken” incident definitely put a damper on the whole experience; however, that (I sincerely hope) does not happen often. It is worth mentioning that they had great service and large portion sizes which left you feeling swaddled in the comfort that southern food is known for. Overall, I would give Deacon’s Corner a solid 3.5/5.</p>

<div id="bobbywing">
<p>Last Sunday, as a weird way of ending the summer break, I headed to Wings Pub and Grill on North Road with a few of my friends, to take on the Bobby Wing Challenge. I suppose I should preface this by saying that I do frequent this particular branch of Wings because of the half priced wings (on Sundays and Wednesdays) and the proximity to my house. This meant that I’ve seen a few people try the Bobby Wing Challenge and run around the restaurant fanning their mouths. They are supposedly the hottest wings in Canada, ringing it at 150,000 on the Scoville scale, so we were all a little nervous about what was going down. </p>

<p>We started the night by ordering some regular wings on the menu that included their Saigon Sriracha Honey and Louisiana Sweet, which are some of my regular favourites and some pop (because you need to order a drink to get half priced wings).Prior to ordering the wings, we told our server that we intended to take on the challenge and he promptly told us that it was horrible idea and that no-one in their right mind would do it as it was that spicy. While that staement definitely freaked out one of my friends, we weren't going to let anyone back out at this point.</p>

<p>Fast forward about half an hour; we had finished our meals and were ready to do what we came for. So the server brought us three little bowls with each of our wings in it. Promptly, three of us started to eat these wings. I should mention that one of my firends ordered the boneless kind to avoid the spice from getting all over his face; however, I along with my other friend decided we wanted the full experience, so we got the orginal wing.</p>

<p>Soon after we devoured the wings, some tears were shed by my companions (LOL). Now, I personally didn't think they were as spicy as they were hyped up to be. I'm not going to sit here and say that they weren't spicy at all (because I'd be lying), but in my opinion, the immediate after effects really were not so bad. Having said all this, I have included some comments from those who disagreed with me on the degree of spice:</p>

<ul><li><q>I didn't feel anything, but then I felt like a dragon because my tongue was on fire</q></li>
<li><q>It didn't really taste strong. The wing was pretty average. It tasted kinda funny (a little bit like celery), but then it felt like Satan's ballsack was dipped into my mouth</q></li></ul>

<p>Now that you know what to expect if you decide to take on the challenge yourself and your not someone who enjoys a ton of spice, here are some tips you might find helpful:</p>

<ul>
<li>Make sure your lips are not chapped prior to eating the wings</li>
<li>Inhale through your mouth and eexhale through your nose</li>
<li>Fight the temptation to sip on your drink! It will make it so much worse!</li>
<li>Don't wipe your mouth with a napkin (unless you want the lower portion of your face to burn)</li>
<li>If you accidentally do wipe your mouth (smh), wash your hands and face with soap and water. The burn will stop immediately</li>
</ul>
